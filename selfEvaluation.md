# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I feel that I need more practice with using `for` statements. I am not confident in by ability to use them without extra support.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I felt challenging but also exciting. I experience both productive struggle and unproductive struggle.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need additional time outside of class hours and after the end of Mod 0 to practice making and using `for` statements.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

 I have many questions. I plan to use the Slack channels as well any web search engine results to get the answers I need.
